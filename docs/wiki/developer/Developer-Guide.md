# Developer Guide

Welcome! This page gets you from an empty folder to a running Git Manager, and then points you to the page you need next.

Git Manager is a native macOS Git client. The backend is Rust on [Tauri 2](https://v2.tauri.app) in `src-tauri/`. The UI is Svelte 5 and TypeScript in `src/`, and every text pane is a CodeMirror 6 editor. The app uses the web view that macOS already ships, so it starts fast and stays small.

## What you need

- **macOS.** The app targets macOS today. Some backend code (the memory readout, the MCP screenshot) is macOS only.
- **Rust (stable)**, installed with [rustup](https://rustup.rs). You also get `cargo` and `clippy`.
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (`xcode-select --install`), for the linker and a system git.
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)**, the only JavaScript tool in this project.
- **git**, any recent version. The app runs your own git binary for every write.

### Why Bun and never npm, npx or node

The system Node on the main development machine is v16, and Vite 8 needs a much newer Node. Instead of asking everyone to manage Node versions, every script in `package.json` runs on Bun's own runtime with `bun --bun`. So please never type `npm`, `npx` or `node`: they would pick up the old Node and fail in confusing ways.

## First run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shibbirweb/git-manager.git
cd git-manager
bun install                    # dependencies (commit bun.lock if it changes)
bun tauri dev                  # run the app with hot reload
bun tauri dev -- -- /path/to/folder   # open a folder straight away
```

The first `bun tauri dev` compiles every Rust crate, so it takes a few minutes. After that, Svelte changes reload instantly and Rust changes rebuild only what changed.

## Demo data

You rarely want to test on a real project. Three scripts build throwaway repositories for you. Each one refuses a folder that is not empty, so it can never overwrite your work.

| Script | What it builds |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/make-conflict-repo.sh <dir> [--rebase]` | A repository stopped in a merge (or a rebase) with every conflict type, long files and M, A, U, D and R samples. Use it for the merge tool and the conflicts dialog. |
| `scripts/make-workspace-demo.sh <dir>` | A folder with several repositories: one nested, one mid-merge, one clean, plus a plain folder with no git. Use it for workspaces. |
| `scripts/make-docs-demo.sh <dir>` | The workspace the wiki screenshots are taken in: a shop repository with four authors, branches, tags, a stash and a remote, a repository with conflicts, a plain `notes/` folder, a second folder, and `extras/` with a submodule and Git LFS images. See [Docs and Screenshots](Docs-and-Screenshots.md). |

```sh
scripts/make-conflict-repo.sh /tmp/conflict-demo
bun tauri dev -- -- /tmp/conflict-demo
```

The Rust tests run `make-conflict-repo.sh` and check its exact output. If you change that script, update `src-tauri/src/git/tests.rs` too.

## The checks

Before you say a change is done, run the checks listed in [Testing](Testing.md#what-done-means): `bun run check`, `bun run test`, `cargo test` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, plus the docs and version checks when you touch those. CI runs the same ones, so a clean local run means a green pull request. To build a release app locally, run `bun tauri build --bundles app`; it lands in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos`.

## Lessons learned

**Node v16 was too old for Vite 8.** Early on, `vite` and `svelte-kit` crashed under the system Node. We could have required a newer Node, but Bun was already installed and can run these tools itself. So every script became `bun --bun <tool>`, which forces Bun's runtime even when a tool's first line asks for `node`.

**`bun --bun tauri` called itself.** The first `tauri` script in `package.json` was `bun --bun tauri`. Bun looks for a script named `tauri` before it looks for a binary, so the script ran itself again and again until macOS refused to start more processes (`EAGAIN`). The script is now `bunx --bun tauri`, which always runs the Tauri CLI binary.

**Port 1420 was already in use.** `bun tauri dev` starts Vite on port 1420, and Vite is set to `strictPort`, because Tauri loads the UI from that exact address. When a dev session dies badly, the old Vite process can keep the port. The fix is to stop the old `bun` or `vite` process before starting again, not to change the port.
