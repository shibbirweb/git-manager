# Git Manager

A native desktop Git client with a JetBrains-style 3-way merge tool, VS Code-style workspaces, tabs, blame and history. Built with Rust (Tauri 2) and a small Svelte 5 UI running in the system web view, so it starts fast and stays light on memory.

Every feature has its own page with screenshots in the [wiki](https://github.com/shibbirweb/git-manager/wiki).

## Features

- **Workspaces like VS Code**: open any folder, whether it is one repository, many (nested ones included) or no git at all (initialize one from the app). Add more folders to the same window, save the set to a `.gitmanager-workspace` file, or open a VS Code `.code-workspace` file. Repositories you clone or create inside an open folder show up on their own, and a progress card shows while a big folder opens.
- **3-way merge tool**: Yours | Result | Theirs panes with connectors, per-change apply and ignore buttons, "apply both" for conflicts, one-click *Apply non-conflicting*, word-level highlights, synchronized scrolling, F7 navigation, full undo and an ignore-whitespace mode.
- **Conflicts made easy**: a Conflicts dialog to take Yours or Theirs for whole files (binary and deleted files too), inline *Accept Current / Incoming / Both* actions in the editor, and Continue, Abort or Skip for merge, rebase, cherry-pick and revert.
- **Native menu bar** with the Git Manager app menu (macOS), File, Edit, View, Code, Git, Window and Help menus, and **Help > Keyboard Shortcuts**, an in-app list of every shortcut.
- **JetBrains-style Git menu**: Commit, Push and Pull dialogs, Update Project, Merge and Rebase dialogs with their options, **Interactive Rebase**, Reset HEAD, Branches, tags, patches, Manage Remotes, Clone, and Current File history, blame and compare views.
- **Changes like VS Code**: staged and unstaged files grouped by repository, each with a branch picker, **Sync Changes** (or **Publish Branch** for a new branch) and a **...** menu of its own actions. Side-by-side diffs (resizable), stage or unstage whole files or single hunks, discard, commit, amend, Commit & Push, Commit & Sync and Commit (Amend), commit options (sign off, author, GPG, skip hooks) and Add to .gitignore.
- **Shelf, worktrees, submodules and Git LFS** from the Git menu, plus a **Git Console** that shows every git command the app runs (off by default).
- **GitHub**: sign in with a token kept in the system keychain or with the GitHub CLI, then Share Project on GitHub, Sync Fork, Create Gist, and open its pull request pages on GitHub.
- **Editor and tabs**: preview tabs (italic, like VS Code), breadcrumbs, change markers in the gutter and on the scrollbar, a find and replace bar, Code menu commands, Render whitespace, line spacing, syntax highlighting, font ligatures and zoom with Ctrl or Cmd + mouse wheel.
- **Search Everywhere**: double Shift for files, classes, symbols and text in every folder, plus Replace in Files.
- **Markdown editor** with a live preview, mermaid diagrams, a formatting toolbar and a Preview Only mode you can type in.
- **Integrated terminal** with several shells, terminals in editor tabs, and a **Scripts** tool window that runs npm, Composer, Make, Deno and just scripts with the right Node version, in a Run tab.
- **Blame**: GitLens-style blame for the current line and a blame gutter; click it to open that commit in the Log on the same line.
- **Log**: paged history with a branch graph, commit details and per-file diffs. Double-click a commit (or use *Open in Tab*) to read it full size in its own tab. Cherry-pick, revert, reset and checkout from the right-click menu.
- **Branches, tags, remotes and stashes**: checkout, create, rename, delete, merge and rebase from the sidebar or the Branches popup; fetch, pull and push with live progress; stash, apply, pop, drop and clear.
- **Back and Forward** across files, diffs and commits, like a browser.
- **37 color themes**, one for light and one for dark mode, following the system by default.
- **Settings** saved in `~/.gitmanager` like VS Code's folder, header buttons that show or hide the left and right activity bars, a status bar with the app's memory use (plus an optional memory log for debugging), and update checks with a stable and a beta channel.
- **MCP server and command line tool** (off by default, local only) so AI tools such as Claude Code can use the app.
- **Works as `git mergetool`** (see below).

## How it works

```
Svelte UI (system WKWebView)  --invoke/events/channels-->  Rust (Tauri commands)
                                                    git2 (libgit2): fast reads (status, index stages, diff, log, refs)
                                                    git CLI: every write, so hooks, credentials, signing and config behave as in the terminal
                                                    merge engine: 3-way chunking with imara-diff (histogram)
                                                    watcher: debounced file events -> "repo-changed"
                                                    services: terminals (PTY), search indexes, scripts, GitHub, MCP server
```

Memory is kept low by design:
- No bundled browser engine; the OS web view is used.
- Rust opens the repository per command and keeps no file contents between calls.
- Diffs load only for the selected file; CodeMirror renders only the visible lines; the log is paged and virtualized.
- Language grammars and big libraries (xterm.js, the Markdown preview, mermaid, color themes) load on first use; features that are off, like the Git Console and the MCP server, cost nothing.
- The merge tool is an overlay in the main window, not a second web view.
- Release builds use `opt-level = "s"`, LTO, `panic = "abort"` and stripped symbols.

## Development

Requirements: Rust (stable), [Bun](https://bun.sh), and git. Bun runs every frontend tool on its own runtime (`bun --bun`), so no Node.js install is needed.

```sh
bun install          # frontend dependencies
bun tauri dev        # run the app with hot reload
bun run check        # svelte-check / TypeScript
bun run test         # frontend unit tests (Vitest)
cd src-tauri && cargo test   # Rust unit and git integration tests
bun tauri build      # release .app and .dmg in src-tauri/target/release/bundle
```

Open a repository from the welcome screen, or pass it on the command line:

```sh
src-tauri/target/release/git-manager /path/to/repo
```

To try the merge tool on a throwaway repository full of conflicts:

```sh
scripts/make-conflict-repo.sh /tmp/conflict-demo
```

To try a folder holding several repositories (one nested, one mid-merge, one clean, plus a plain folder):

```sh
scripts/make-workspace-demo.sh /tmp/workspace-demo
```

## Documentation

The [wiki](https://github.com/shibbirweb/git-manager/wiki) has a user guide with screenshots of every feature and developer docs with a chapter per feature (why it exists, how it works, the bugs we fixed). Its source is `docs/wiki/`: edit it there, never in the wiki. CI checks it with `bun scripts/build-wiki.ts --check`, and `.github/workflows/wiki.yml` publishes it when `master` changes. Screenshots are regenerated with `bun scripts/screenshots.ts` (see `docs/wiki/developer/Docs-and-Screenshots.md`).

## Continuous integration and releases

- **Branches**: work merges into `develop` (the beta line) by pull request; `master` is stable.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to `develop` and `master` and every pull request, on macOS: `bun scripts/version.ts check`, `bun run check`, `bun run test`, `bun scripts/build-wiki.ts --check`, `cargo test` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
- **Versions and notes**: the version lives in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and only the release workflows move it. Release notes come from `CHANGELOG.md`, so write each change under `## [Unreleased]` in the same pull request.
- **Releases** are automated: the "Beta release" and "Stable release" workflows open a release pull request; once it is merged (and, for a stable release, the `develop` to `master` pull request too), the GitHub release is published and the macOS app is built. Builds are unsigned unless the `APPLE_*` secrets are set.

The [Releases and CI](https://github.com/shibbirweb/git-manager/wiki/Releases-and-CI) page has the full flow, every workflow and the one-time repository setup; [Updates](https://github.com/shibbirweb/git-manager/wiki/Updates) explains the stable and beta channels.

## Using it as `git mergetool`

After building, point git at the binary inside the app bundle:

```sh
APP="/Applications/Git Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/git-manager"
git config --global mergetool.gitmanager.cmd "\"$APP\" merge \"\$BASE\" \"\$LOCAL\" \"\$REMOTE\" \"\$MERGED\""
git config --global mergetool.gitmanager.trustExitCode true
git config --global merge.tool gitmanager
```

Then `git mergetool` opens each conflicted file. **Apply** (or Cmd+Enter) writes the result and exits with status 0, so git marks the file resolved. **Cancel**, Esc or closing the window asks first if you changed the result, then exits with status 1 and the file stays unresolved. Cmd+Q quits with status 1 without asking.

## Settings

Open **Settings** with the gear button in the header, **Git Manager > Settings...** or **Cmd+,**. Its sections are Appearance, Editor, Git, Layout, Terminal, GitHub, Automation, Updates, Settings Files and About. Changes apply immediately and are saved, like VS Code's `~/.vscode`, in a folder in your home directory:

```
~/.gitmanager/
  settings.json   preferences (theme and color themes, fonts, editor, Git, terminal, automation); safe to edit by hand
  state.json      recent folders, active repository per folder, panel layout and sizes
  github.json     the signed-in GitHub login (the token itself stays in the system keychain)
  mcp.json        the MCP server's secret token, plus its port while it runs
  logs/memory.log the debug memory log, only while it is on
```

The folder is created the first time a setting is saved. If `settings.json` or `state.json` contains invalid JSON, the app uses defaults for that file only, shows the error in Settings, and never overwrites it: fix it and click **Try Again**, or **Reset** it. The [Settings page](https://github.com/shibbirweb/git-manager/wiki/Settings) lists every setting.

## Keyboard shortcuts

A few to start with (macOS keys; Help > Keyboard Shortcuts lists them all):

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Shift Shift | Search Everywhere |
| Cmd+P / Cmd+O / Option+Cmd+O | Go to File / Class / Symbol |
| Shift+Cmd+F / Shift+Cmd+R | Find in Files / Replace in Files |
| Cmd+F / Cmd+R | Find / Replace in the editor |
| Cmd+S / Option+Cmd+S | Save / Save All |
| Cmd+K / Cmd+T | Commit / Update Project |
| Cmd+9 | Show Git Log |
| Ctrl+` / Ctrl+Shift+` | Show or hide the terminal / New terminal |
| Cmd+B / Option+Cmd+B | Files panel / Sidebar |
| Cmd+, | Settings |

In the merge tool:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| F7 / Shift+F7 | Next / previous unresolved change |
| Cmd+Z / Shift+Cmd+Z | Undo / redo in the result (also restores chunk state) |
| Cmd+Enter | Apply (save the result and mark resolved), from any pane |
| Esc | Cancel (asks first if you changed the result) |

Every shortcut is on the [Keyboard Shortcuts page](https://github.com/shibbirweb/git-manager/wiki/Keyboard-Shortcuts).
