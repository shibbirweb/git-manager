# Test Suites

This is the list of what the tests cover, folder by folder. How to run them, the helpers and the rules are on [Testing](Testing.md). On 2 October 2026 the Vitest suites held 934 tests in 96 files and the Rust code had 424 `#[test]` functions for `cargo test`; the numbers grow with every feature, so treat them as a rough size, not a target.

## Vitest suites (`bun run test`)

Files are `<name>.test.ts` next to the module they test. Folders are under `src/lib/` unless shown otherwise.

## Rust tests (`cargo test`)

Most modules test themselves in a `#[cfg(test)]` block; the bigger ones have a `tests.rs` beside them.

| Module | What the tests cover |
| --- | --- |
| `commands/tests.rs` | whole commands against real repositories: staging, commits, conflicts, mergetool |
| `commands/*.rs` | branch actions, commit options, history, ignore files, Merge and Rebase options, patches, interactive rebase (with merges), remotes, clone and cancel, shelf, stash, status, tags, config |
| `git/tests.rs` and `git/*.rs` | readers and the CLI runner, the demo script, blame, cancel, files, LFS, submodules, worktrees |
| `merge/engine.rs` | the 3-way engine and its oracle test against `git merge-file` |
| `watcher.rs` | attribution, ignored paths, linked git folders, index invalidation |
| `terminal.rs`, `run_process.rs` | shells, PTYs, hang up and kill, script runs and the login environment |
| `scripts/`, `node_versions.rs` | each script file format, the wanted Node version, installed versions |
| `file_search.rs`, `symbols/`, `text_search/` | indexing, matching, caps, cancel, the symbol scanners, Replace in Files |
| `git_console.rs` | recording, masking secrets, limits, off means nothing |
| `shelf/` | patch sections and the store |
| `github/tests.rs` | every GitHub path against a fake network, keychain and gh |
| `mcp/tests.rs` and `mcp/*.rs` | the server over real HTTP, tokens, paths, the tool registry, install, the CLI client |
| `preview_scheme/tests.rs` | the `gmpreview` scheme: URL decoding, ranges, the folder check, work tree files and revisions of real repositories |
